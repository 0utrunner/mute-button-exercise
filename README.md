Mute Button
===================
Continuing in our exploration handling interactions and events in React, we'll now create a simple UI - but without `<input>` elements.  In addition to learning how to handle click events, you'll also learn how to utilize SVGs in React apps.

Primary Objectives
-------------

 1. Scaffold the app using create-react-app.
 2. Render the **on.svg** image from the icons directory and attach an onClick event listener to it.  
 3. When the image is clicked, toggle it to the **off.svg** image - and vice versa.  on -> off -> on -> off.
